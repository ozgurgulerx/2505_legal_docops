Provider acknowledges and agrees that Customer retains the right to audit the scope of Services periodically to ensure compliance with quality standards, service level agreements ("SLAs"), and other performance criteria set forth in this Agreement or any SoW, provided that such audits shall not unreasonably interfere with Provider's business operations or impose undue burdens, except to the extent required to remedy any non-compliance identified during such audits.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may terminate this Agreement for cause upon written notice to the other party, specifying the nature of the breach and allowing a thirty-day cure period, except where such breach is incapable of cure or involves a material violation of law, in which case termination shall be immediate and without further notice.
