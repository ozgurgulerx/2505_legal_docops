The purpose of this Master Services Agreement (hereinafter referred to as “Agreement”) effective as of the Effective Date above, between the Customer, a large U.S.-based enterprise, and the Provider, a fictitious technology provider specializing in Communication Platform as a Service (CPaaS) solutions, is to set forth the terms under which Provider shall supply certain services and solutions to Customer, subject to the terms and conditions herein, notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to further stipulations detailed in subsequent sections of this Agreement. Definitions contained herein shall apply throughout this Agreement and any Exhibits attached hereto, unless otherwise specified, with the parties agreeing to the following specific definitions: “Customer Data” refers to any data provided by Customer to Provider for processing, “Services” shall mean the CPaaS solutions and associated support offered by Provider, “Agreement” encompasses this document including all attachments, addenda, and amendments thereto, and “Effective Date” signifies the date when the Agreement becomes operational, provided that all conditions precedent have been satisfied, including but not limited to compliance with any applicable regulatory requirements which may be imposed under U.S. telecom law. The scope of Services includes but is not limited to voice and messaging services, API access, and technical support, and is further delineated in the attached Schedule A, provided however that the scope may be adjusted as per the change control procedures set forth herein. Provider shall ensure that the Services are delivered in accordance with the Service Level Agreement (SLA) detailed in Section 7, which outlines minimum performance criteria including uptime targets and response times, notwithstanding any force majeure events that may impact Provider’s ability to meet such criteria, subject to the limitations and exclusions provided therein. Background context for this Agreement includes the Customer’s intent to leverage Provider’s CPaaS solutions to enhance its telecommunications capabilities, particularly in the areas of emergency call routing as stipulated under Section 4, with the Provider acknowledging its expertise in such domains and committing to adhere to all relevant compliance requirements, including those related to Customer Proprietary Network Information (CPNI) as defined under U.S. telecom law.

This section outlines the fees applicable for the Services, which shall be calculated based on the fee schedule provided in Exhibit B, subject to any adjustments as per the terms herein and payable by Customer within thirty (30) days of receipt of Provider’s invoice, unless disputed in accordance with the dispute resolution process detailed in Section 10. The fee structure includes fixed monthly charges for access to Provider’s platform, variable charges based on usage metrics, and any applicable taxes, duties, or levies imposed by governmental authorities which shall be borne by Customer, except where expressly stated otherwise. Provider shall submit invoices electronically to Customer’s designated billing contact, with all necessary supporting documentation to substantiate the charges, and Customer shall have the right to audit Provider’s records related to the Services to verify the accuracy of invoices, with such audit rights being exercisable upon reasonable notice and during Provider’s normal business hours, provided that Customer shall comply with any confidentiality obligations imposed by Provider during the course of such audits. In the event of any discrepancies identified during an audit, Provider shall promptly correct the errors and issue a revised invoice to Customer, and in the case of overpayment, Provider shall refund the excess amount to Customer within fifteen (15) business days from the date of identification of such discrepancy, notwithstanding any other remedies available to Customer under the Agreement. Provider shall maintain accurate and complete records of all transactions related to the Services for a minimum period of three (3) years following the termination of this Agreement, subject to any longer retention requirements under applicable law, and shall ensure that such records are readily accessible for audit purposes.

## Section 3: Indemnities, Liabilities, and Limitations

Confidential – Page 3 of Y

Provider hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer, its affiliates, and their respective directors, officers, employees, and agents from and against any and all claims, liabilities, damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) arising out of or resulting from Provider’s breach of any representation, warranty, or obligation under this Agreement, or from any negligent act or omission by Provider or its subcontractors in connection with the performance of the Services, except to the extent that such claims arise out of Customer’s negligence or wilful misconduct. Provider’s indemnification obligations shall be contingent upon Customer promptly notifying Provider of any claim, demand, or action giving rise to such obligations, and Customer shall provide Provider with reasonable assistance and cooperation in the defense or settlement thereof, provided that Provider shall have sole control over the defense and settlement of any such claim, subject to Customer’s rights to approve any settlement that imposes obligations on Customer other than payment of money. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither party shall be liable to the other for any indirect, consequential, incidental, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, revenue, or data, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, even if such party has been advised of the possibility of such damages, provided however that this limitation shall not apply to any indemnity obligations under this section or to any breach of confidentiality obligations under Section 5. The aggregate liability of Provider for any and all claims under this Agreement shall not exceed the total fees paid by Customer to Provider under this Agreement during the twelve (12) months preceding the event giving rise to the claim, except in cases of gross negligence, fraud, or intentional misconduct by Provider. Remedies provided to Customer under this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive, and Customer shall have the right to pursue any and all remedies available under applicable law in addition to those specified herein. Provider acknowledges that any breach of its confidentiality obligations may result in irreparable harm to Customer for which monetary damages may not be sufficient, and Customer shall be entitled to seek injunctive relief in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity.

Provider shall ensure that the Services meet or exceed the performance criteria outlined in the Service Level Agreement attached hereto as Exhibit C, which includes specific metrics for system availability, response times, and issue resolution, notwithstanding any force majeure events or other circumstances beyond Provider’s reasonable control. Provider acknowledges the critical nature of emergency call services provided hereunder and agrees to comply with all applicable regulations and technical specifications related thereto, including those set forth by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other relevant authorities, without limiting the generality of the foregoing. Provider shall implement robust security measures to protect the integrity and confidentiality of Customer Data, especially in relation to emergency call routing, and shall provide detailed documentation of such measures upon Customer’s request, subject to any applicable confidentiality restrictions.
