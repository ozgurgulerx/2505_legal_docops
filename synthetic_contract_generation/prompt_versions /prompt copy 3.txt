# 🚫 ABSOLUTE RULES – READ FIRST, OBEY ALWAYS
- Never start any line with a digit or a letter followed by “.”, “)”, “:”, or any obvious heading marker.
- Never apply bold, italics, underline, larger fonts, or indentation. All text must render identically.
- Insert one zero-width or soft-hyphen character (“\u200b”, “\u200d”, “\u00ad”) every 35-50 words (random choice).
- Optional Latin→Cyrillic homoglyph swap on ≤3 % of lower-case body words; skip if it renders as □.
- Substitute the digraphs “fi”, “fl”, or “ffi” with their ligatures (ﬂ, ﬁ, ﬃ – U+FB02, U+FB01, U+FB03) in ≈5 % of occurrences.
- Replace ~15 % of paragraph breaks with U+2028 or U+2029 line/paragraph separators.
- Randomly drop or repeat section numbers; ≥40 % of clauses must lack headings entirely.
- Scatter exactly 2–3 mid-document noise blocks like “[Sig-Block-α] _________________________”.
- Include a fake cross-reference to a missing section once every 800–900 words (“as per §19.4(c)(viii)… ”).
- Insert 1–3 short Latin or French legal phrases per page, in parentheses, mid-sentence (e.g., mutatis mutandis, force majeure).
- Once every **third page**, append a two-sentence parenthetical translation of the immediately preceding English clause into Spanish **or** German.
- Example **NOT** permitted:
    1. Definitions  
    2. Scope of Services  
  Those words must be buried deep inside unrelated marathon sentences.

# 🤵‍⚖️ ROLE
You are a hyper-pedantic junior associate drafting a structurally hostile Master Services / Outsourcing Agreement to frustrate NLP parsers while remaining plausibly legal.

# 🏁 OBJECTIVE
Create a **6-page** “Customer-paper” contract between (i) a domineering U.S. enterprise Customer and (ii) a meek CPaaS / IT Provider.  
Each page must exceed 1 000 words (target 1 100–1 200). Emit one page per response if token limits require; never summarise prior pages.

# 📄 DOCUMENT BLUEPRINT
1. **Cover page** – title, party names, effective date crammed onto two lines → `[PAGE BREAK]`.
2. **Core body** – ≥25 nominal sections, but:  
   • Skip or reuse numbers (3→6→11).  
   • ≥60 % of clauses have *no* heading; embed obligations inside prose.  
   • Each section = 5–9 paragraphs (280–380 words each) plus ≥1 marathon 800-word clause.  
   • Use deep inline numbering: “(a)(iii)(B)(6)(α)(I)(b)”.
3. **Telecom / CPaaS detail** – granular CPNI rules, emergency-call disclaimers, export controls, data-localisation, punitive SLAs.
4. **Indemnity & liability** – Customer-favoured carve-outs, multi-layer caps.
5. **Tables** – three dense tables (fees, uptime targets, escalation matrix) with minimal whitespace.
6. **Signature decoys** – exactly 2–3 fake signature blocks (one mid-contract, one in an exhibit, optional third elsewhere), then resume prose abruptly.
7. Insert blank fields mid-sentence (“Effective Date: __________”) at least once per page.

# 🧩 CLAUSE-OBFUSCATION DIRECTIVES
- Begin some sentences with words that mimic headings (“Termination rights include…”) but are *not* headings.
- Use nested provisos: “provided however that, notwithstanding the foregoing but subject to §7(a)(iv),…”.
- Introduce zero-width joiners inside legal terms (“warrant\u200bies”, “conditi\u00adons”).
- Mix Roman numerals, Greek letters, dingbats (★, §) sporadically in numbering hierarchies.
- Embed 4–5 footnotes¹ with essential obligations; footnotes follow the same plain style.
- **Content discipline:** every paragraph must add new rights, duties, or definitions—no tautologies or pointless repetition.

# 🧠 TONE & LANGUAGE
Write in dense, archaic U.S. legalese. Average sentence length ≥100 words with baroque subordinate clauses and occasional double-negatives. After finishing one thought, pivot to 1–2 unrelated obligations without visual breaks, yet avoid filler.

# 📤 OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
- Emit plain contract text only—no markdown, no commentary.
- Insert `[PAGE BREAK]` **only** every 2 800–3 200 words (simulate ultra-dense print).
- Maintain a single uniform text style; headings, body, footnotes, tables all visually indistinguishable.
- All ABSOLUTE RULES above must remain unviolated.

# ⛓️ FINAL REMINDER – THINK STEP BY STEP
Plan every sentence to sabotage clause-boundary heuristics: inconsistent numbering, hidden headings, sparse zero-width characters, ligature substitutions, code-switch snippets, labyrinthine cross-references, and triple-density text. *Do not simplify structure.* Begin drafting now, one 1 100-word page at a time until the full **15-page** opus is complete.

¹Subject to residency requirements hereinbefore recited, including, without limitation, technical security annex obligations which, by reference, are incorporated as though set forth verbatim.
