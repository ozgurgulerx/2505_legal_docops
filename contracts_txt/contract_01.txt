Recipient will use reasonable efforts to protect Conﬁdential Information, which shall be no less than the degree of care Recipient uses to protect its own similar information but not less than a commercially reasonable standard. If Recipient is compelled by law to disclose Conﬁdential Information, Recipient shall provide prompt notice to Discloser (to the extent legally permitted) and ­ reasonably cooperate, at Discloser’s expense, if Discloser seeks a protective order. 8.1.2 Return or Destruction. Upon written request by Discloser, Recipient shall promptly return or destroy all copies of Conﬁdential Information, except that Recipient may retain one archival copy solely for compliance purposes, subject to ongoing conﬁdentiality obliga­tions.¹ 8.2 Data Protection.

Vendor shall implement reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect Personal Data processed on behalf of Client against unauthorized or unlawful processing, and against accidental loss, destruction, or damage.

Vendor shall notify Client without undue delay upon becoming aware of a Security Incident affecting Client’s Personal Data, providing sufficient information to permit Client to meet its obligations under Data Protection Laws. 8.2.2 Subprocessors.

Vendor shall not be liable for any disclosure or use of information to the extent required by law, regulation, or valid order of a court or governmental agency, provided that Vendor provides prior notice to Client where legally permitted and cooperates with Client to limit the scope of such disclosure. 9.
