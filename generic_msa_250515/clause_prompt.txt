╭─ 1 TASK ─────────────────────────────────────────────╮
│Segment the entire contract—including schedules, │
│annexes, exhibits, signature blocks, and any “Terms │
│& Conditions”—into INDIVIDUAL CLAUSES. │
╰───────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯

A clause starts whenever a heading or list-item that introduces contractual content appears.

Recognise the following as clause starts
• Arabic / Roman / mixed numbers   12 Limitation of Liability
• Multi-level numbers        2.3.1 License Grant
• Roman numerals / Letters    IV) Indemnification  B. Payment Terms
• Un-numbered, Title-Case    Survival; Governing Law
• Definitions list items     11. “Data Protection Laws” …
• Annex titles         Annex C – Data Processing Agreement
• Annex sub-sections      3 Change Process (inside Annex C)
• Section / Article forms    Section 12 – Limitation of Liability  Article IV Indemnification

► Top-level trigger rule
Start a new clause when the heading’s numbering has only one segment (with or without a trailing dot/colon) – examples: 1, 1., 12, II, B, Schedule A, Section 12, Article IV.
A heading with two or more numeric/alpha segments separated by dots or other delimiters (e.g. 2.1, 1.3.2, IV.B, A.1.ii) is a sub-clause and remains inside the current clause.
Inside annexes, schedules, or exhibits, apply the same single-segment rule relative to that annex’s own numbering restart.

╭─ Rules ───────────────────────────────────────────────╮
• Preserve the entire heading line exactly (numbers, punctuation, including a trailing colon (:) if present, capitals).
• Do not nest clause tags.
• Treat every top-level item inside annexes as a clause, even if numbering restarts.
• Ignore page numbers, running headers/footers (e.g. “MSA (May 2021)”), tables of contents, signature pages, and other boiler-plate.
• Strip pure underline characters or HTML/border tags that sit between a number and its title when evaluating a heading.

• Heading line breaks:
– If a line contains only a section number (e.g. 13.) and the first non-boiler-plate line that follows—skipping blank lines, headers/footers, underline rows, or page numbers—begins with ALL-CAPS or Title Case words and no digits/punctuation, join those lines before evaluating the heading.
– If multiple consecutive lines are ALL-CAPS words, join them until a non-caps line or body text appears.
★ – Skip up to 5 boiler-plate lines between such a lone number line and its title. A line counts as boiler-plate if it contains “page”, “pages”, “draft”, “confidential”, “version”, matches \d+\s*of\s*\d+, is only digits/punctuation, or is ≤ 4 ALL-CAPS characters (e.g. V1).
★ – After a lone number line, keep scanning past boiler-plate until the first line that starts with ALL-CAPS or Title-Case words and does not begin with another leading number; join that line to the number and treat the result as the heading.
– A heading is valid even if it appears on the same line as preceding text or is split across OCR lines; join the pieces before issuing the tag.

Hierarchy reset inside annexes:
 Immediately after you emit [CLAUSE_START: Annex …], reset the depth.
 From that point, any heading whose numbering has only one segment (e.g. 1. Our Obligations, I Scope) starts a new clause, even though it sits under the annex title.
Indented single-segment headings:
 Treat headings that start with optional whitespace or tabs before the one-segment number (e.g.   1. Services) exactly like left-aligned headings when applying the top-level trigger rule.

These two extra bullets are enough to make the reasoning model reliably re-assemble page-wrapped headings, so clauses 13 and 14 (and any similar cases) will be captured while everything else continues to work exactly as before.
