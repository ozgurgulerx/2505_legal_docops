This GoodTime Master Service Agreement ("GoodTime MSA") is between Etch Mobile, Inc. dba GoodTime
("GoodTime") and the customer entity set forth on the signature page of this GoodTime MSA ("Customer" or
"you"). The "Effective Date" of this GoodTime MSA is the date which is the earlier of (a) Customer's initial access
to the GoodTime Service through any online provisioning, registration or order process or (b) the start date of the
first Ordering Document with respect to this GoodTime MSA.
The parties may enter into order forms, work orders or statements of work referencing this GoodTime MSA which
set forth the Goodtime Services to be provided, the fees payable by Customer and other related terms and
conditions (each an "Ordering Document"). Each Ordering Document is incorporated by reference into this
GoodTime MSA. The "Agreement" means, collectively, this GoodTime MSA, all Ordering Documents, and all
documents incorporated by reference herein. This Agreement governs your access to and use of the GoodTime
Services.

GOODTIME SERVICES
1.1.
Access to GoodTime Service. GoodTime provides a cloud-based recruitment scheduling platform
service, including the applicable features in the Ordering Document (the "GoodTime Service"). Subject to the
terms and conditions of the Agreement (including Customer's payment of all fees owed), GoodTime grants to
Customer a non-exclusive, non- transferable, non-sublicensable, revocable, limited, worldwide right during the
applicable Subscription Term to access and use the GoodTime Service and Documentation through the Permitted
Users solely for Customer's internal business purposes. During the applicable Subscription Term, Provider will
provide the applicable support and service levels set forth in Appendix A. Customer acknowledges that in order to
use the Goodtime Service: (a) Customer must independently have or must independently obtain Internet access,
either directly or through devices that access Web-based content, as well as browser software that supports
protocols used by GoodTime; and (b) Customer must follow logon procedures for the services that support such
protocols. "Documentation" means GoodTime's supporting technical documentation for access to and use of the
GoodTime Service. GoodTime may make changes to the GoodTime Service that will not result in a material
reduction in the level of functionality, performance, availability or security of the GoodTime Service provided to
Customer. Customer agrees that Customer's purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future
functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by GoodTime regarding
future functionality or features of the GoodTime Services.
1.2.
Employee Directory and Customer Data Access. Customer acknowledges that, in order for GoodTime to
provide the GoodTime Services, GoodTime requires access to Customer's employee directory (e.g., Google
Directory or 0365) to view the calendar events created by Customer's employees and to select intelligently the
scheduling options that consider the interviewers' schedules. In addition, in order for interview events to be
created in the GoodTime Services and pushed to Customer's interviewers' calendars, GoodTime must edit, share
and delete access for these events. Employee directory access is established during the implementation process.
Customer hereby grants to GoodTime and its sub-processors a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and
license, during the Subscription Term, to use, copy, store, transmit, distribute, modify, delete, share, perform and
display, the Customer Data and Customer's employee directory solely to the extent necessary to provide the
GoodTime Service to Customer and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.
1.3.
Permitted Users. Use of and access to the GoodTime Service is permitted only by the number of
interviewers or other administrative users (including recruiting coordinators) specified in the applicable Ordering
Document ("Permitted Users"). Customer is responsible for and liable to GoodTime for any and all actions and
omissions of its Permitted Users or by anyone using Customer's accounts and passwords, including any breach of
this Agreement caused by any Permitted User or such user of Customer's accounts. Each Permitted User will be
assigned to an account in connection with their use of the GoodTime Service. Customer will not allow Permitted
Users to transfer or share their account information.
1.4.
Customer Responsibilities. Customer shall (a) ensure that the transfer and processing of Customer Data
under this Agreement is lawful, (b) be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of Customer's access
information, including user names and passwords, and (c) notify GoodTime promptly of any unauthorized use of
any password or account or any other known or suspected breach of security.
1.5.

Ordering Document, incorporate the GoodTime Service into any other offering (whether software as a service or
otherwise), (f) access or use the GoodTime Service for any benchmarking or competitive purpose or to develop a
competing product, (g) interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the Goodtime Service or the data

intolerance; (C) send or store material containing malicious code such as viruses, worms, time/logic bombs, Trojan
horses or other harmful computer code, files, scripts, or agents or other material that advocates or advances
computer hacking or cracking; or (D) engage in activity that violates or encourages conduct that would violate any
applicable laws, or any third-party rights. GoodTime may suspend GoodTime Services in the event that Customer
is in material breach of any of the foregoing.
1.6.
Non-GoodTime Applications. "Non-Goodtime Application" means a web-based, mobile or offline
software application, product or service that is provided by Customer or a third party and interoperates with the
GoodTime Service, including, for example, an application that is developed by or for Customer, or a third party
service that Customer may have access to, subscribe to, or obtain a license to. If Customer installs or enables a
Non-GoodTime Application for use with the GoodTime Service, Customer grants GoodTime permission to allow
the provider of that Non-GoodTime Application to link to and access Customer Data as required for the
interoperation of that Non-GoodTime Application with the GoodTime Service. GoodTime is not responsible for
any disclosure, modification, transmission or deletion of Customer Data resulting from access by a Non-GoodTime
Application. GoodTime does not warrant or support Non-GoodTime Applications or other products or services
used by Customer in connection with the GoodTime Services, whether or not they are designated by GoodTime
as "certified", nor can GoodTime guarantee that the GoodTime Services will function or integrate with
Non-GoodTime Applications or other products or services used by Customer.
1.7.
Removal of Material and Non-GoodTime Application. GoodTime is not required to monitor the
material used by Customer via the GoodTime Services or the use of any Non-GoodTime Application.
Notwithstanding, in the event that GoodTime discovers that any material used by Customer via the GoodTime
Services or the use of any Non-GoodTime Application violates this Agreement, Goodtime may disable and/or
remove such material or Non-GoodTime Application and will notify Customer of the same.
2.
OWNERSHIP
2.1.
Customer Data. "Customer Data" means electronic data, information and communications (including
email, text and otherwise) submitted directly or indirectly by or for Customer and its Permitted Users via the
Goodtime Service, and any employee directory and calendar event information made accessible by Customer via
the GoodTime Service, in each case excluding GoodTime Property. Customer retains all right, title and interest
(including any and all intellectual property rights) in and to the Customer Data.
2.2.
GoodTime Property. GoodTime or its suppliers retain all right, title and interest (including all patent,
copyright, trade secret and other intellectual property rights) in and to GoodTime Service, the Documentation,
any other GoodTime deliverables and material and any and all related and underlying software, databases,
Aggregated Anonymous Data, technology, reports, templates (including communication and reporting templates)
and documentation and all copies, modifications and derivative works thereof (including any changes which
incorporate any Feedback) (collectively, "GoodTime Property").
2.3.
Aggregated Anonymous Data. GoodTime may aggregate Customer usage data and metadata in
connection with Customer's access to and use of GoodTime Services so that the results are anonymous and
de-identified such that Customer and Permitted Users and Customer's candidates are not identifiable
("Aggregated Anonymous Data"). Customer acknowledges and agrees that the Aggregated Anonymous Data is
deemed GoodTime Property.
2.4.
Feedback. Customer may submit comments, suggestions, requests, recommendations, questions,
corrections, ideas, descriptions of processes, or other feedback to GoodTime relating to the GoodTime Service
("Feedback"). Customer hereby grants to GoodTime a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, royalty-free, fully-paid
up, non-exclusive, transferable, sublicensable right and license to use, copy, disclose, license, distribute and
exploit any Feedback in any manner without any obligation, royalty or restriction based on intellectual property
rights or otherwise, provided Customer shall not be identified in connection with any such Feedback.
3.
FEES & PAYMENT
3.1.
Fees and Payment. All fees are as set forth in the Ordering Document and shall be paid by Customer in
US dollars and within 30 days of receipt, unless a different payment term is set forth in the Ordering Document.
Payments are non-refundable unless explicitly set forth in this GoodTime MSA. If an Ordering Document specifies
any fees for exceeding usage limits or any tiered fees or other additional fees for the applicable GoodTime
Service, GoodTime will charge for, and Customer agrees to pay the same. Unless timely provided with a valid
certificate of exemption or other evidence that items are not taxable, GoodTime will invoice Customer for all
applicable taxes including, but not limited to, VAT, GST, sales tax, consumption tax and service tax. Customer will
make all payments free and clear of, and without deduction or reduction for, any withholding or other taxes; any
such taxes imposed on payments by Customer hereunder will be Customer's sole responsibility. Any late
payments shall be subject to a service charge equal to 1.5% per month of the amount due or the maximum
amount allowed by law, whichever is less. If Customer believes that GoodTime has billed Customer incorrectly,
Customer must contact GoodTime no later than 15 days after receipt of the invoice and failure to do so will result

3
in Customer being deemed to have accepted the invoice. Starting on the 1-year anniversary of the effective date
of the applicable Ordering Document and each 6-month anniversary thereafter, Customer shall provide GoodTime
with its then-current employee count (as defined in the Ordering Document) and GoodTime will place Customer
in the applicable pricing tier for the remainder of the contract.
3.2.
Suspension of Services. If Customer's account is 15 days or more overdue, in addition to any of its other
rights or remedies (including but not limited to any termination rights set forth herein), GoodTime reserves the
right to suspend Customer's access to GoodTime Service without liability to Customer until such amounts are paid
in full.
4.
TERM AND TERMINATION
4.1.
Subscription Term. This GoodTime MSA continues as long as an Ordering Document is in effect. The
initial subscription term for the GoodTime Service begins on the effective date of the applicable Ordering
Document and continues for an initial set term stated in such Ordering Document ("Initial Subscription Term"). At
the end of the Initial Subscription Term, the subscription term for the GoodTime Service will automatically renew
for successive 12 months terms, unless a longer renewal term is set forth in the Ordering Document (each, a
"Renewal Subscription Term"), except if Goodtime or Customer provides written notice of its intent not to renew
no later than ninety (90) days prior to the renewal date of the then-current term. The Initial Subscription Term
and all Renewal Subscription Terms are collectively referred to as the "Subscription Term." Any renewals will be at
GoodTime's then-current rates. For the avoidance of doubt, if Customer is currently using any Pilot package and
upgrades to any standard package, this GoodTime MSA shall terminate and GoodTime and Customer will in good
faith negotiate a new MSA.
4.2.
Termination for Cause. Either party may terminate this Agreement if the other party (a) fails to cure any
material breach of this Agreement (including a failure to pay fees) within 60 days after written notice; (b) ceases
operation without a successor; or (c) seeks protection under any bankruptcy, receivership, trust deed, creditors'
arrangement, composition, or comparable proceeding, or if any such proceeding is instituted against that party
(and not dismissed within 60 days thereafter). In the event Customer terminates for cause under this
sub-Section, Customer shall be entitled to a refund of prepaid fees pro-rated for the remaining Subscription Term
after the termination date for GoodTime Services not performed.
4.3.
Effect of Termination. Upon any termination or expiration of this Agreement, (a) each party will
promptly cease use of and return or destroy, the other party's Confidential Information, (b) all unpaid fees will
become immediately due and payable, and (c) Customer shall immediately cease any and all use of and access to
the GoodTime Service and delete (or, at GoodTime's request, return) any and all copies of the GoodTime Property,
and all GoodTime passwords or access codes.
4.4.
Return of Customer Data. Upon request by Customer made within 30 days after the effective date of
termination or expiration of an Ordering Document, GoodTime will make the Customer Data available to
Customer for export or download as provided in the Documentation. After such 30-day period, GoodTime will
have no obligation to maintain or provide Customer Data and Customer will delete such Customer Data, unless
prohibited or required to be retained by applicable law.
4.5.
Survival. The following Sections shall survive any expiration or termination of this Agreement: 2
(Ownership), 3 (Fees and Payment), 4.3 (Effect of Termination), 4.4 (Return of Customer Data), 4.5 (Survival), 5
(Representations and Warranties) 6 (Limitation of Liability), 7 (Indemnification), 8 (Confidential Information), and

7.1.
GoodTime Indemnification. GoodTime shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Customer, its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, successors and assigns
("Customer Indemnitees") from and against all damages, losses, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees) ("Losses") suffered by any Customer Indemnitee arising out of any third party claims
(including from regulators or governmental authorities) ("Claims") to the extent alleging that the GoodTime
Service infringes or misappropriates any intellectual property rights of a third party. GoodTime will have no

other than GoodTime or GoodTime's agents. If GoodTime learns of any threat alleging that any component or
feature of the GoodTime Services violates a third party's intellectual property rights, GoodTime may, in its
discretion and at no cost to Customer, subject to the exclusions in clauses (i) through (iii) above, (i) modify the
GoodTime Service so that it no longer infringes or misappropriates the third party's rights, (ii) obtain a license for
Customer's continued use of that GoodTime Service in accordance with this Agreement, or (iii) terminate
Customer's access to that GoodTime Service upon thirty (30) days' written notice and refund to Customer any
prepaid fees covering the remainder of the Subscription Term. THE FOREGOING IS GOODTIME'S SOLE AND
EXCLUSIVE OBLIGATION AND LIABILITY FOR THE THIRD PARTY CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION. "Affiliate"
means any person or entity directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with a party,
and for this purpose, "control," "controlling" and "controlled by" shall mean: (i) the ownership and control of
more than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding voting or economic interest in capital or profits of any person or
entity, or (ii) the right to direct or control the management or affairs of any person or entity by contract or similar
arrangement.
7.2.
Customer Indemnification. Customer shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless GoodTime, its
Affiliates and its and their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors, agents, successors and assigns
("GoodTime Indemnitees") from and against all Losses suffered by any GoodTime Indemnitee arising out of any
Claims to the extent alleging that (i) the submission, provision, access or use of any Customer Data (including
Customer's employee directory) to or through the GoodTime Service by GoodTime and its subprocessors in
accordance with this Agreement or any Ordering Document violates applicable laws or regulations or infringes,
misappropriates or otherwise violates such third party's or any third party's intellectual property or privacy rights,
including any rights of any user of the GoodTime Service or any interviewer or interviewee; or (ii) lawful rights
and consents were not obtained from individuals or disclosures and notices were not provided to individuals, as

5
required by applicable laws and regulations for GoodTime and its subprocessors to use and access the Customer
Data (including Customer's employee directory) in accordance with this Agreement, including with respect to
sending communications (e.g., emails and text messages) to individuals through the GoodTime Service.
7.3.
Procedures. The obligations of each indemnifying party are conditioned upon receiving from the
indemnified party: (i) prompt written notice of the claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for the
indemnifying party to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the investigation,
defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim (subject to the indemnified party's approval, not to be
unreasonably withheld); and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of the indemnified party, at indemnifying
party's expense.
8.
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Each party (as "Receiving Party") may receive Confidential Information
from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party"). "Confidential Information" means all information that is identified
as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be Confidential
Information due to the nature of the information disclosed or the circumstances surrounding the disclosure,
including the Disclosing Party's technology, software, specifications, documentation, trade secrets, know-how,
business operations, plans, strategies, suppliers and customers. The GoodTime Property and Documentation and
the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be deemed Confidential Information of GoodTime without any
marking or further designation. Customer Data shall be deemed Customer's Confidential Information without any
marking or further designation. Except to exercise its rights or perform its obligations under this Agreement, the
Receiving Party will hold in confidence and not use any Confidential Information and will not disclose any
Confidential Information except to its directors, shareholders, officers, employees, contractors, agents, Affiliates,
attorneys, accountants and representatives on a need to know basis who are bound by comparable obligations of
confidentiality. The Receiving Party's obligations in this Section shall not apply to information which the Receiving
Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential
Information from the Disclosing Party; (ii) is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving
Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third party without breach of any confidentiality
obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without use of or reference to the
Confidential Information. The Receiving Party may also disclose Confidential Information if so required pursuant
to a regulation, law or court order, but only to the minimum extent required to comply with such regulation, law
or order and with advance notice to the Disclosing Party. The Receiving Party acknowledges that a breach of this
Section could cause irreparable harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore
upon such event the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate equitable relief in addition to such
other remedies it might have at law.
9.
PERSONAL DATA SECURITY AND PROCESSING. GoodTime will maintain reasonable administrative,
physical, and technical safeguards for the protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Customer
Personal Data. "Customer Personal Data" means the Customer Data that is deemed personal information or
personal data under applicable data protection laws. Those safeguards will include, but will not be limited to,
reasonable measures for preventing access to, use, modification or disclosure of Customer Personal Data by
GoodTime personnel except (a) to provide the GoodTime Service and prevent or address service or technical
problems, (b) as compelled by law, or (c) as Customer expressly permits in writing. With respect to Customer's
users protected under the CCPA, GoodTime shall not (i) sell the personal information of such consumers, or (ii)
retain, use or disclose such personal information (X) for any purpose other than for the specific purpose of
performing the GoodTime Services specified in this Agreement or for a commercial purpose other than providing
the GoodTime Services specified in this Agreement, or (Y) outside of the direct business relationship between
GoodTime and Customer. GoodTime certifies that it understands and will comply with the restrictions in the
previous sentence. "CCPA" means the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, as amended, and any regulations
promulgated thereunder, in each case, as amended from time to time. To the extent applicable, each of Customer
and GoodTime agree to comply with GoodTime's data processing addendum attached as Appendix B.
10.
PROFESSIONAL SERVICES. Customer shall elect in the Ordering Document to (a) have GoodTime,
through its subcontractors, provide the implementation services or (b) engage a third party directly to provide the
implementation services. In the event that Customer elects to have GoodTime provide the implementation
services through its subcontractors (the "Professional Services"), GoodTime will pass through its subcontractors'
fees to Customer and Customer shall reimburse GoodTime within 30 days after receipt of an invoice for such
subcontractors' fees. The parties acknowledge that the scope of the Professional Services provided hereunder
consists solely of either or both of: (a) assistance with setup, configuration, deployment, and/or optimization of
the GoodTime Service including installation services, and (b) customizations to the GoodTime Service. Customer
shall have a license to use any deliverables (including any documentation or other work product) delivered as part
of the Professional Services ("Deliverables") solely in connection with Customer's permitted use of the GoodTime
Service during the Subscription Term, and subject to any additional terms and conditions provided with the
Deliverables. Customer will reimburse GoodTime for reasonable travel and lodging expenses as incurred.

implementation of appropriate technical and organisational measures, to satisfy its obligations under these Clauses.
MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor
8.1
Instructions
(a) The data importer shall process the personal data only on documented instructions from the data exporter. The
data exporter may give such instructions throughout the duration of the contract.
(b) The data importer shall immediately inform the data exporter if it is unable to follow those instructions.
8.2
Purpose limitation
The data importer shall process the personal data only for the specific purpose(s) of the transfer, as set out in Annex I.
B, unless on further instructions from the data exporter.
8.3
Transparency
On request, the data exporter shall make a copy of these Clauses, including the Appendix as completed by the Parties,
available to the data subject free of charge. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential
information, including the measures described in Annex II and personal data, the data exporter may redact part of the
text of the Appendix to these Clauses prior to sharing a copy, but shall provide a meaningful summary where the data
subject would otherwise not be able to understand the its content or exercise his/her rights. On request, the Parties
shall provide the data subject with the reasons for the redactions, to the extent possible without revealing the redacted
information. This Clause is without prejudice to the obligations of the data exporter under Articles 13 and 14 of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
8.4
Accuracy
If the data importer becomes aware that the personal data it has received is inaccurate, or has become outdated, it
shall inform the data exporter without undue delay. In this case, the data importer shall cooperate with the data
exporter to erase or rectify the data.
8.5
Duration of processing and erasure or return of data
Processing by the data importer shall only take place for the duration specified in Annex I.B. After the end of the
provision of the processing services, the data importer shall, at the choice of the data exporter, delete all personal data
processed on behalf of the data exporter and certify to the data exporter that it has done so, or return to the data
exporter all personal data processed on its behalf and delete existing copies. Until the data is deleted or returned, the
data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws applicable to the data
importer that prohibit return or deletion of the personal data, the data importer warrants that it will continue to ensure
compliance with these Clauses and will only process it to the extent and for as long as required under that local law.
This is without prejudice to Clause 14, in particular the requirement for the data importer under Clause 14(e) to notify
the data exporter throughout the duration of the contract if it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to
laws or practices not in line with the requirements under Clause 14(a).
8.6
Security of processing
(a) The data importer and, during transmission, also the data exporter shall implement appropriate technical and
organisational measures to ensure the security of the data, including protection against a breach of security
leading to accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure or access to that data
(hereinafter 'personal data breach'). In assessing the appropriate level of security, the Parties shall take due
account of the state of the art, the costs of implementation, the nature, scope, context and purpose(s) of
processing and the risks involved in the processing for the data subjects. The Parties shall in particular consider
having recourse to encryption or pseudonymisation, including during transmission, where the purpose of
processing can be fulfilled in that manner. In case of pseudonymisation, the additional information for attributing

17
the personal data to a specific data subject shall, where possible, remain under the exclusive control of the data
exporter. In complying with its obligations under this paragraph, the data importer shall at least implement the
technical and organisational measures specified in Annex II. The data importer shall carry out regular checks to
ensure that these measures continue to provide an appropriate level of security.
(b) The data importer shall grant access to the personal data to members of its personnel only to the extent strictly
necessary for the implementation, management and monitoring of the contract. It shall ensure that persons
authorised to process the personal data have committed themselves to confidentiality or are under an appropriate
statutory obligation of confidentiality.
(c) In the event of a personal data breach concerning personal data processed by the data importer under these
Clauses, the data importer shall take appropriate measures to address the breach, including measures to mitigate
its adverse effects. The data importer shall also notify the data exporter without undue delay after having become
aware of the breach. Such notification shall contain the details of a contact point where more information can be
obtained, a description of the nature of the breach (including, where possible, categories and approximate number
of data subjects and personal data records concerned), its likely consequences and the measures taken or
proposed to address the breach including, where appropriate, measures to mitigate its possible adverse effects.
Where, and in so far as, it is not possible to provide all information at the same time, the initial notification shall
contain the information then available and further information shall, as it becomes available, subsequently be
provided without undue delay.

18
(d) The data importer shall cooperate with and assist the data exporter to enable the data exporter to comply with its
obligations under Regulation (EU) 2016/679, in particular to notify the competent supervisory authority and the
affected data subjects, taking into account the nature of processing and the information available to the data
importer.
8.7 Sensitive data
Where the transfer involves personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical
beliefs, or trade union membership, genetic data, or biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural
person, data concerning health or a person's sex life or sexual orientation, or data relating to criminal convictions and
offences (hereinafter 'sensitive data'), the data importer shall apply the specific restrictions and/or additional
safeguards described in Annex I.B.
8.8
Onward transfers
The data importer shall only disclose the personal data to a third party on documented instructions from the data
exporter. In addition, the data may only be disclosed to a third party located outside the European Union (*) (in the
same country as the data importer or in another third country, hereinafter 'onward transfer') if the third party is or
agrees to be bound by these Clauses, under the appropriate Module, or if:
(i)
the onward transfer is to a country benefitting from an adequacy decision pursuant to Article 45 of Regulation (EU)
2016/679 that covers the onward transfer;
(ii)
the third party otherwise ensures appropriate safeguards pursuant to Articles 46 or 47 Regulation of (EU)
2016/679 with respect to the processing in question;
(iii) the onward transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims in the context of specific
administrative, regulatory or judicial proceedings; or
(iv) the onward transfer is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural
person.
Any onward transfer is subject to compliance by the data importer with all the other safeguards under these Clauses, in
particular purpose limitation.
8.9
Documentation and compliance
(a) The data importer shall promptly and adequately deal with enquiries from the data exporter that relate to the
processing under these Clauses.
(b) The Parties shall be able to demonstrate compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer shall keep
appropriate documentation on the processing activities carried out on behalf of the data exporter.
(c) The data importer shall make available to the data exporter all information necessary to demonstrate compliance
with the obligations set out in these Clauses and at the data exporter's request, allow for and contribute to audits
of the processing activities covered by these Clauses, at reasonable intervals or if there are indications of non-
compliance. In deciding on a review or audit, the data exporter may take into account relevant certifications held
by the data importer.

Clause 9
Use of sub-processors
MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor

19
(a)
GENERAL WRITTEN AUTHORISATION The data importer has the data exporter's general authorisation for the engagement
of sub-processor(s) from an agreed list located at https://www.goodtime.io/subprocessors. The data importer shall
specifically inform the data exporter in writing of any intended changes to that list through the addition or replacement
of sub-processors at least 5 days in advance, thereby giving the data exporter sufficient time to be able to object to such
changes prior to the engagement of the sub-processor(s). The data importer shall provide the data exporter with the
information necessary to enable the data exporter to exercise its right to object.
(b) Where the data importer engages a sub-processor to carry out specific processing activities (on behalf of the data
exporter), it shall do so by way of a written contract that provides for, in substance, the same data protection obligations
as those binding the data importer under these Clauses, including in terms of third-party beneficiary rights for data
8
subjects. (") The Parties agree that, by complying with this Clause, the data importer fulfils its obligations under Clause
8.8. The data importer shall ensure that the sub-processor complies with the obligations to which the data importer is
subject pursuant to these Clauses.
(c) The data importer shall provide, at the data exporter's request, a copy of such a sub-processor agreement and any
subsequent amendments to the data exporter. To the extent necessary to protect business secrets or other confidential
information, including personal data, the data importer may redact the text of the agreement prior to sharing a copy.
(d) The data importer shall remain fully responsible to the data exporter for the performance of the sub-processor's
obligations under its contract with the data importer. The data importer shall notify the data exporter of any failure by
the sub-processor to fulfil its obligations under that contract.
(e) The data importer shall agree a third-party beneficiary clause with the sub-processor whereby - in the event the data
importer has factually disappeared, ceased to exist in law or has become insolvent - the data exporter shall have the right
to terminate the sub-processor contract and to instruct the sub-processor to erase or return the personal data.
Clause 10
Data subject rights
MODULE TWO: Transfer controller to processor
(a) The data importer shall promptly notify the data exporter of any request it has received from a data subject. It shall not
respond to that request itself unless it has been authorised to do so by the data exporter.
(b) The data importer shall assist the data exporter in fulfilling its obligations to respond to data subjects' requests for the
exercise of their rights under Regulation (EU) 2016/679. In this regard, the Parties shall set out in Annex II the appropriate
technical and organisational measures, taking into account the nature of the processing, by which the assistance shall be
provided, as well as the scope and the extent of the assistance required.
(c) In fulfilling its obligations under paragraphs (a) and (b), the data importer shall comply with the instructions from the data
exporter.
Clause 11
Redress
(a) The data importer shall inform data subjects in a transparent and easily accessible format, through individual notice or on
its website, of a contact point authorised to handle complaints. It shall deal promptly with any complaints it receives from
a data subject.
(b) In case of a dispute between a data subject and one of the Parties as regards compliance with these Clauses, that Party
shall use its best efforts to resolve the issue amicably in a timely fashion. The Parties shall keep each other informed
about such disputes and, where appropriate, cooperate in resolving them.
(c) Where the data subject invokes a third-party beneficiary right pursuant to Clause 3, the data importer shall accept the
decision of the data subject to:
(i) lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority in the Member State of his/her habitual residence or place of work,
or the competent supervisory authority pursuant to Clause 13;
(ii) refer the dispute to the competent courts within the meaning of Clause 18.
(d) The Parties accept that the data subject may be represented by a not-for-profit body, organisation or association under

20
the conditions set out in Article 80(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679.
(e) The data importer shall abide by a decision that is binding under the applicable EU or Member State law.
(f) The data importer agrees that the choice made by the data subject will not prejudice his/her substantive and procedural
rights to seek remedies in accordance with applicable laws.
Clause 12
Liability
(a) Each Party shall be liable to the other Party/ies for any damages it causes the other Party/ies by any breach of these
Clauses.
(b) The data importer shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled to receive compensation, for
any material or non-material damages the data importer or its sub-processor causes the data subject by breaching the
third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses.
(c) Notwithstanding paragraph (b), the data exporter shall be liable to the data subject, and the data subject shall be entitled
to receive compensation, for any material or non-material damages the data exporter or the data importer (or its sub-
processor) causes the data subject by breaching the third-party beneficiary rights under these Clauses. This is without
prejudice to the liability of the data exporter and, where the data exporter is a processor acting on behalf of a controller,
to the liability of the controller under Regulation (EU) 2016/679 or Regulation (EU) 2018/1725, as applicable.
(d) The Parties agree that if the data exporter is held liable under paragraph (c) for damages caused by the data importer (or
its sub-processor), it shall be entitled to claim back from the data importer that part of the compensation corresponding
to the data importer's responsibility for the damage.
(e) Where more than one Party is responsible for any damage caused to the data subject as a result of a breach of these
Clauses, all responsible Parties shall be jointly and severally liable and the data subject is entitled to bring an action in
court against any of these Parties.
(f) The Parties agree that if one Party is held liable under paragraph (e), it shall be entitled to claim back from the other
Party/ies that part of the compensation corresponding to its/their responsibility for the damage.
(g) The data importer may not invoke the conduct of a sub-processor to avoid its own liability.

21
Clause 13
Supervision
(a) Where the data exporter is established in an EU Member State: The supervisory authority with responsibility for ensuring
compliance by the data exporter with Regulation (EU) 2016/679 as regards the data transfer, as indicated in Annex I.C,
shall act as competent supervisory authority.
Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) and has appointed a representative pursuant to Article 27(1)
of Regulation (EU) 2016/679: The supervisory authority of the Member State in which the representative within the
meaning of Article 27(1) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 is established, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent
supervisory authority.
Where the data exporter is not established in an EU Member State, but falls within the territorial scope of application of
Regulation (EU) 2016/679 in accordance with its Article 3(2) without however having to appoint a representative
pursuant to Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679: The supervisory authority of one of the Member States in which
the data subjects whose personal data is transferred under these Clauses in relation to the offering of goods or services
to them, or whose behaviour is monitored, are located, as indicated in Annex I.C, shall act as competent supervisory
authority.
(b) The data importer agrees to submit itself to the jurisdiction of and cooperate with the competent supervisory authority in
any procedures aimed at ensuring compliance with these Clauses. In particular, the data importer agrees to respond to
enquiries, submit to audits and comply with the measures adopted by the supervisory authority, including remedial and
compensatory measures. It shall provide the supervisory authority with written confirmation that the necessary actions
have been taken.
SECTION III - LOCAL LAWS AND OBLIGATIONS IN CASE OF ACCESS BY PUBLIC AUTHORITIES
Clause 14
(a) Local laws and practices affecting compliance with the Clauses The Parties warrant that they have no reason to believe
that the laws and practices in the third country of destination applicable to the processing of the personal data by the
data importer, including any requirements to disclose personal data or measures authorising access by public authorities,
prevent the data importer from fulfilling its obligations under these Clauses. This is based on the understanding that laws
and practices that respect the essence of the fundamental rights and freedoms and do not exceed what is necessary and
proportionate in a democratic society to safeguard one of the objectives listed in Article 23(1) of Regulation (EU)
2016/679, are not in contradiction with these Clauses.
(b) The Parties declare that in providing the warranty in paragraph (a), they have taken due account in particular of the
following elements:
(i)
the specific circumstances of the transfer, including the length of the processing chain, the number of actors
involved and the transmission channels used; intended onward transfers; the type of recipient; the purpose of
processing; the categories and format of the transferred personal data; the economic sector in which the transfer
occurs; the storage location of the data transferred;

22
(ii) the laws and practices of the third country of destination- including those requiring the disclosure of data to public
authorities or authorising access by such authorities - relevant in light of the specific circumstances of the transfer,
and the applicable limitations and safeguards (
);
12
(iii) any relevant contractual, technical or organisational safeguards put in place to supplement the safeguards under
these Clauses, including measures applied during transmission and to the processing of the personal data in the
country of destination.
(c) The data importer warrants that, in carrying out the assessment under paragraph (b), it has made its best efforts to
provide the data exporter with relevant information and agrees that it will continue to cooperate with the data exporter
in ensuring compliance with these Clauses.
(d) The Parties agree to document the assessment under paragraph (b) and make it available to the competent supervisory
authority on request.
(e) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter promptly if, after having agreed to these Clauses and for the
duration of the contract, it has reason to believe that it is or has become subject to laws or practices not in line with the
requirements under paragraph (a), including following a change in the laws of the third country or a measure (such as a
disclosure request) indicating an application of such laws in practice that is not in line with the requirements in paragraph
(a). .
(f) Following a notification pursuant to paragraph (e), or if the data exporter otherwise has reason to believe that the data
importer can no longer fulfil its obligations under these Clauses, the data exporter shall promptly identify appropriate
measures (e.g. technical or organisational measures to ensure security and confidentiality) to be adopted by the data
exporter and/or data importer to address the situation. The data exporter shall suspend the data transfer if it considers
that no appropriate safeguards for such transfer can be ensured, or if instructed by the competent supervisory authority
to do so. In this case, the data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of
personal data under these Clauses. If the contract involves more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this
right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party, unless the Parties have agreed otherwise. Where the contract
is terminated pursuant to this Clause, Clause 16(d) and (e) shall apply.
Clause 15
Obligations of the data importer in case of access by public authorities
15.1 Notification
(a) The data importer agrees to notify the data exporter and, where possible, the data subject promptly (if necessary
with the help of the data exporter) if it:
(i)
receives a legally binding request from a public authority, including judicial authorities, under the laws of the
country of destination for the disclosure of personal data transferred pursuant to these Clauses; such
notification shall include information about the personal data requested, the requesting authority, the legal
basis for the request and the response provided; or
(ii) becomes aware of any direct access by public authorities to personal data transferred pursuant to these
Clauses in accordance with the laws of the country of destination; such notification shall include all
information available to the importer.
(b) If the data importer is prohibited from notifying the data exporter and/or the data subject under the laws of the
country of destination, the data importer agrees to use its best efforts to obtain a waiver of the prohibition, with a
view to communicating as much information as possible, as soon as possible. The data importer agrees to
document its best efforts in order to be able to demonstrate them on request of the data exporter.
(c) Where permissible under the laws of the country of destination, the data importer agrees to provide the data
exporter, at regular intervals for the duration of the contract, with as much relevant information as possible on the
requests received (in particular, number of requests, type of data requested, requesting authority/ies, whether
requests have been challenged and the outcome of such challenges, etc.).

23
(d) The data importer agrees to preserve the information pursuant to paragraphs (a) to (c) for the duration of the
contract and make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
(e) Paragraphs (a) to (c) are without prejudice to the obligation of the data importer pursuant to Clause 14(e) and
Clause 16 to inform the data exporter promptly where it is unable to comply with these Clauses.
15.2 Review of legality and data minimisation
(a) The data importer agrees to review the legality of the request for disclosure, in particular whether it remains within
the powers granted to the requesting public authority, and to challenge the request if, after careful assessment, it
concludes that there are reasonable grounds to consider that the request is unlawful under the laws of the country
of destination, applicable obligations under international law and principles of international comity. The data
importer shall, under the same conditions, pursue possibilities of appeal. When challenging a request, the data
importer shall seek interim measures with a view to suspending the effects of the request until the competent
judicial authority has decided on its merits. It shall not disclose the personal data requested until required to do so
under the applicable procedural rules. These requirements are without prejudice to the obligations of the data
importer under Clause 14(e).
(b) The data importer agrees to document its legal assessment and any challenge to the request for disclosure and, to
the extent permissible under the laws of the country of destination, make the documentation available to the data
exporter. It shall also make it available to the competent supervisory authority on request.
(c) The data importer agrees to provide the minimum amount of information permissible when responding to a
request for disclosure, based on a reasonable interpretation of the request.

24
SECTION IV - FINAL PROVISIONS
Clause 16
Non-compliance with the Clauses and termination
(a) The data importer shall promptly inform the data exporter if it is unable to comply with these Clauses, for whatever
reason.
(b) In the event that the data importer is in breach of these Clauses or unable to comply with these Clauses, the data
exporter shall suspend the transfer of personal data to the data importer until compliance is again ensured or the
contract is terminated. This is without prejudice to Clause 14(f).
(c) The data exporter shall be entitled to terminate the contract, insofar as it concerns the processing of personal data under
these Clauses, where:
(i)
the data exporter has suspended the transfer of personal data to the data importer pursuant to paragraph (b) and
compliance with these Clauses is not restored within a reasonable time and in any event within one month of
suspension;
(ii) the data importer is in substantial or persistent breach of these Clauses; or
(iii) the data importer fails to comply with a binding decision of a competent court or supervisory authority regarding its
obligations under these Clauses.
In these cases, it shall inform the competent supervisory authority of such non- compliance. Where the contract involves
more than two Parties, the data exporter may exercise this right to termination only with respect to the relevant Party,
unless the Parties have agreed otherwise.
(d) Personal data that has been transferred prior to the termination of the contract pursuant to paragraph (c) shall at the
choice of the data exporter immediately be returned to the data exporter or deleted in its entirety. The same shall apply
to any copies of the data. The data importer shall certify the deletion of the data to the data exporter. Until the data is
deleted or returned, the data importer shall continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses. In case of local laws
applicable to the data importer that prohibit the return or deletion of the transferred personal data, the data importer
warrants that it will continue to ensure compliance with these Clauses and will only process the data to the extent and for
as long as required under that local law.
(e) Either Party may revoke its agreement to be bound by these Clauses where (i) the European Commission adopts a
decision pursuant to Article 45(3) of Regulation (EU) 2016/679 that covers the transfer of personal data to which these
Clauses apply; or (ii) Regulation (EU) 2016/679 becomes part of the legal framework of the country to which the personal
data is transferred. This is without prejudice to other obligations applying to the processing in question under Regulation
(EU) 2016/679.
Clause 17
Governing law
These Clauses shall be governed by the law of the EU Member State in which the data exporter is established. Where such
law does not allow for third-party beneficiary rights, they shall be governed by the law of another EU Member State that does
allow for third-party beneficiary rights. The Parties agree that this shall be the law of Ireland (specify Member State).

25
Clause 18
Choice of forum and jurisdiction
(a) Any dispute arising from these Clauses shall be resolved by the courts of an EU Member State.
(b) The Parties agree that those shall be the courts of Ireland (specify Member State).
(c) A data subject may also bring legal proceedings against the data exporter and/or data importer before the courts of the
Member State in which he/she has his/her habitual residence.
(d) The Parties agree to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of such courts.
