Obligations), (b) any service or product offered by Customer in connection with or related to the Service or (c) sharing of Customer
Materials with (or use thereof by) Third-Party Users or Third-Party Projects. This indemnification obligation is subject to Customer receiving

LIMITATION OF REMEDIES AND DAMAGES

HAVE ANY LIABILITY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT FOR ANY LOSS OF USE, LOST DATA, LOST PROFITS, FAILURE OF

apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), strict liability or otherwise and will survive and apply
even if any limited remedy specified in this Agreement is found to have failed of its essential purpose.
16.
INDEMNIFICATION. DNAnexus shall defend Customer from and against any claim by a third party alleging the Service when used
as authorized under this Agreement infringes a U.S. patent, U.S. copyright, or U.S. trademark and shall indemnify and hold harmless
Customer from and against any damages and costs awarded against Customer or agreed in settlement by DNAnexus (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) resulting from such claim, provided that DNAnexus shall have received from Customer: (i) prompt written notice of such
claim (but in any event notice in sufficient time for DNAnexus to respond without prejudice); (ii) the exclusive right to control and direct the
investigation, defense and settlement (if applicable) of such claim; and (iii) all reasonable necessary cooperation of Customer. If Customer's
use of the Service is (or in DNAnexus' opinion is likely to be) enjoined, if required by settlement or if DNAnexus determines such actions are
reasonably necessary to avoid material liability, DNAnexus may, in its sole discretion: (a) substitute substantially functionally similar
products or services; (b) procure for Customer the right to continue using the Service; or if (a) and (b) are not commercially reasonable, (c)
terminate the Agreement and refund to Customer the fees paid by Customer for the portion of the Subscription Term that was paid by
Customer but not rendered by DNAnexus. The foregoing indemnification obligation of DNAnexus shall not apply: (1) if the Service is
modified by any party other than DNAnexus, but solely to the extent the alleged infringement is caused by such modification; (2) if the
Service is combined with platforms, data, products or processes not provided by DNAnexus, but solely to the extent the alleged
infringement is caused by such combination; (3) to any unauthorized use of the Service; (4) to any action arising as a result of Customer
Materials, Library Tools or any other third-party deliverables or components contained within the Service; (5) to the extent the alleged
infringement is not caused by the particular technology or implementation of the Service but instead by features common to any similar
product or service; or (6) if Customer settles or makes any admissions with respect to a claim without DNAnexus' prior written consent.
THIS SECTION 16 SETS FORTH DNANEXUS' AND ITS SUPPLIERS' SOLE LIABILITY AND CUSTOMER'S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH
RESPECT TO ANY CLAIM OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT.
17.
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION. Each party (as "Receiving Party") agrees that all code, inventions, know-how, business, technical
and financial information it obtains from the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing
Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by
the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the
disclosure. Any DNAnexus Technology, performance information relating to the Service, and the terms and conditions of this Agreement
shall be deemed Confidential Information of DNAnexus without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein,
the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential
Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may
disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know
(including, for DNAnexus, the subcontractors referenced in Section 19.9), provided that such representatives are bound to confidentiality
obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 17 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance
by any such representative with the terms of this Section 17. The Receiving Party's confidentiality obligations shall not apply to information
that the Receiving Party can document: (i) was rightfully in its possession or known to it prior to receipt of the Confidential Information; (ii)
is or has become public knowledge through no fault of the Receiving Party; (iii) is rightfully obtained by the Receiving Party from a third
party without breach of any confidentiality obligation; or (iv) is independently developed by employees of the Receiving Party who had no
access to such information. The Receiving Party may make disclosures to the extent required by law or court order, provided the Receiving
Party notifies the Disclosing Party in advance and cooperates in any effort to obtain confidential treatment. The Receiving Party
acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient
remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party shall be entitled to seek appropriate
equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.

other party in connection with this Agreement. Each party acknowledges that the other may already possess or have developed such
materials. In addition, each party shall be free to use its general knowledge, skills and experience, and any ideas, concepts, know-how, and

SERVICE LEVELS
1. Target Availability. DNAnexus will use commercially reasonable efforts to make the Service available with an uptime of at least 99.6%
of all Scheduled Availability Time ("Target Availability"), calculated on a monthly, per-hour basis.
2.

2.1.
a maintenance window of thirty (30) minutes scheduled on Tuesdays between 1:00 pm and 8:00 pm Pacific Time;
2.2.
any maintenance window for which notification is provided at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance;
2.3.
any time during which login is disabled due to lack of Customer login activity during a prescribed period or due to excessive
failed login attempts;
2.4.
any time during which a login attempt fails because of a forgotten password; or
2.5.
any time during which the Service is unavailable due to (a) use of the Service by Customer in a manner not authorized in this
Agreement or the applicable Documentation; (b) Customer's equipment, software, Tools, network connections or other
infrastructure; (c) general Internet problems, force majeure events or other factors outside of DNAnexus's reasonable control
(including Tools; denial of service attacks and failures of third party equipment, software or other technology not in

3.
Procedure.
To be eligible to receive Service Credits (as defined below), Customer must submit a claim by email to
support@dnanexus.com for any Service downtime no later than five (5) business days after such downtime. The claim must include (a)
the words "Service Credit Request" in the subject line, (b) the dates and times of any Service downtime and (c) Customer logs,
redacted to omit confidential or sensitive information, that document and corroborate Customer's attempted activity that failed.
DNAnexus will have no obligation to issue Service Credits if the procedures of this Section 3 are not followed.
4.
Service Credits. In the event that DNAnexus confirms at the end of a calendar month that the Target Availability was not met,
Customer will be eligible to receive a number of Service Credits.
4.1.
Each "Service Credit" is 1% of the total fees payable by Customer for the Service in a calendar month in which the Target
Availability is not met.
4.2.
The number of Service Credits that Customer may receive will be calculated as follows:
Uptime
Service Credits
99.00% - 99.59%

98.00% - 98.99%
10

4.3.
DNAnexus shall apply each Service Credit to Customer's next invoice, provided that Customer's account is fully paid up,
without any outstanding payment issues or disputes. Customer will not receive any refunds for any unused Service Credits. A
Service Credit will be issued only if the credit amount for the applicable monthly billing cycle is greater than $10.
5.
Exclusive Remedies. Service Credits constitute liquidated damages and are not a penalty. Service Credits shall be Customer's sole and
exclusive remedy, and DNAnexus's sole and exclusive liability, for DNAnexus's failure to meet the Target Availability.

Exhibit C
DATA AND SECURITY POLICY
Introduction
At DNAnexus we take the protection of Customer Data extremely seriously. This Data and Security Policy ("Policy") describes the
organizational and platform-wide technical measures implemented by DNAnexus that are designed to prevent unauthorized access, use,
alteration or disclosure of Customer Data. The DNAnexus Service operates on Amazon Web Services ("AWS") or Microsoft Azure ("Azure")
as selected by Customer (collectively, the "Infrastructure Providers"); this Policy describes activities of DNAnexus within its instance on the
applicable Infrastructure Provider unless otherwise specified.
Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Policy will have the meanings set forth in the DNAnexus online "Subscription Terms of
Service" (https://www.dnanexus.com/terms) or in the Master Subscription Agreement between DNAnexus and you ("Customer") under
which Customer is granted access to the DNAnexus Service ("Agreement"). In the event of any conflict or inconsistency between the
Agreement and this Policy, this Policy will control.
1.
General Security Features of the DNAnexus Service
1.1. Industry standard virtual firewall and other security technologies.
1.2. Network infrastructure for DNAnexus instances designed with physical and logical access controls based on the "principle of
least access," including filters that allow only the minimum required traffic.
1.3. Procedures to manage system-level access.
1.4. Policy and role-based access control model to log User access information for compliance audit and incident investigation
purposes.
1.5. Two-factor authentication and certificates (or an alternative strong authentication method) to authenticate DNAnexus' remote
administrators who manage the DNAnexus Service.
1.6. Implementation of system software upgrades and patches, including a patching review interval of once per calendar quarter for
security impacting patches. In addition to this regular patching review schedule, if DNAnexus becomes aware at any time of a
security vulnerability with the DNAnexus Service, DNAnexus shall implement appropriate patches promptly and in the case of
critical patches, as soon as possible.
1.7. Testing, evaluating, and authorizing system components before implementation.
1.8. Periodic risk assessments and other procedures designed to detect actual and attempted attacks or intrusions into systems and
to proactively test security procedures (for example, penetration testing).
1.9. Destruction and disposal of Customer Data in accordance with applicable industry standards, such as the DoD 5220.22-M, FIPS
800-88, and DIN 66399 standards for data sanitation.
2. Encryption
2.1. Encryption Algorithms. DNAnexus uses cryptographic algorithms that have been published and evaluated by the general
cryptographic community to encrypt Customer Data at rest and in transit. DNAnexus shall use encryption algorithms that have
at least 256-bit key lengths (or the cryptographic equivalent).
2.2. Data Transfers. DNAnexus uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) standards, or then-current successor protocols, designed to protect
Customer Data from unauthorized access during transfers to and from the DNAnexus Service. Each SSL connection will use at
least AES-256 encryption. All HTTP communications will use SSL connections via the HTTPS protocol.
2.3. Passwords. DNAnexus stores User passwords within a secured database server hosted on the applicable Infrastructure Provider,
using industry standard security measures behind DNAnexus' firewall. DNAnexus uses SHA-256 or another hashing function of
at least equivalent strength to scramble or hash the password database. The DNAnexus Service requires passwords upon
startup to connect to Customer's Account. Alternatively, customers may configure their org to use their own Single Sign On
(SSO), whereupon the password complexity and multifactor authentication is the responsibility of the customer.
2.4. Encryption Key Management. DNAnexus uses commercially reasonable encryption key management procedures, including
maintaining customer-specific encryption keys and logically segregating encryption keys from encrypted Customer Data. Upon
Customer's request, no more than one time per year, DNAnexus shall provide documentation of its security controls for
encryption key management. DNAnexus shall utilize an effective key destruction technique, such as crypto shredding, to ensure
that the encryption keys are destroyed and unrecoverable after the Agreement is terminated.
