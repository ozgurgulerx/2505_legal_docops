WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. LOGICALY DOES NOT AUTHORIZE ANYONE, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOGICALLY EMPLOYEES, AGENTS, OR REPRESENTATIVES, TO MAKE A WARRANTY OF ANY KIND ON ITS
BEHALF AND CUSTOMER SHOULD NOT RELY ON ANY SUCH STATEMENT.
17. Termination; Effect of Termination. The Agreement may be terminated upon the occurrence of any of the following:
(a) by Logically at any time upon written notice if Customer fails to comply with the terms of the Agreement
(including but not limited to the Section titled "Customer Responsibilities") or promptly pay in full to
Logically any amounts, charges or taxes required to be paid under the Agreement or any other agreement
with Logically;
(b) by Customer timely providing written notice of its intent for the Agreement to not automatically renew as
provided for in the Section titled "Term; Payment Obligation for Services";
(c) by either Party at any time in the event of a material breach of the terms hereof by giving the other Party
ninety (90) days written notice stating the nature of the breach. The MSA and applicable Order Form shall
then terminate if the breaching Party shall fail to cure such material breach within ninety (90) days of receipt
of written notice thereof. If the breach is of such a nature that it cannot reasonably be cured within such
period, the breaching Party shall commence to cure said breach within such period, then diligently
prosecute such cure to completion. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of multiple agreements
between the parties, any non-materially breached agreement shall remain in full force and effect;
(d) by Logically for any reason or no reason, upon ninety (90) days written notice to Customer; or
(e) by Logically without notice, if in Logically's sole discretion Customer and/or its use of the Services violates
its responsibilities concerning Software Products related to or under the Agreement.2
Termination of the Agreement shall constitute termination of the applicable Order Form. Termination of the
Agreement does not relieve the Customer's obligations to pay all accrued fees and amounts. In the case of any
hardware leases or rentals, the outstanding balance is due in full upon termination of the Agreement. In the event
of termination or cancellation, Customer must discontinue use of the Services, relinquish use of any IP addresses
and server names assigned to it by Logically in connection with the Services (including pointing the DNS for its domain
name(s) away from Logically Services), stop using and/or accessing Software Products, if applicable, and destroy all
copies of Software Products and all of their component parts. Following termination of the Agreement, Logically

subsection. In the event Customer's access right(s) are suspended, (a) Customer shall remain responsible for all service related
charges and Taxes and Fees Customer has incurred through the date of Suspension; (b) Customer shall remain responsible for
any applicable charges and Taxes and Fees for Services to which Customer continues to have access, as well as applicable data
storage fees and charges, and fees and charges for in-process tasks completed after the date of suspension; (c) Customer shall
not be entitled to any service credits or offsets for any period of suspension; and (d) Logically will not be obligated to erase any
of Customer's content as a result of the suspension, except as may be specified elsewhere in the Agreement.

information. Customer is responsible for paying any such additional fee in advance of Logically's post-termination
cooperation.
18. Termination Charges. Cancelation, termination, or default by Customer of the Agreement prior to the end of the
Term (except in the event of a material breach by Logically as provided for in Section 17(c) or by Logically as set forth
in Section 17(d)) will result in the immediate acceleration of all charges to be due under the Agreement, including
all recurring Services3, from the date of cancelation through the end of the Term. Termination charges associated
with any Professional Service, as set forth in the applicable Order Form shall also come due. Customer is also
responsible for all prior outstanding balances (including any accrued interest charges), actual usage and associated
Taxes and Fees on all amounts due or coming due. Customer hereby authorizes Logically to charge/debit Customer's
authorized payment account for all such termination charges and any service deposits held by Logically on
Customer's behalf will be refunded at that time. Customer agrees that thedamages that would be sustained by
Logically from Customer's early termination or default of an Order Form or this Agreement cannot readily be
determined and that the termination charge constitutes "liquidated damages" and nota penalty. Customer waives
any claim that such termination charge constitutes a penalty.
19. Survivability. The provisions of this Agreement that, by their nature and content, must survive completion, rescission,
termination or expiration of the Agreement in order to achieve the fundamental purposes of the Agreement
(including, without limitation, confidentiality, dispute resolution, and indemnification), shall so survive and continue.
