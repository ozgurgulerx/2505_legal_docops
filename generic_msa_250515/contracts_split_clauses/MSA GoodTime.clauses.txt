In addition, in order for interview events to be created in the GoodTime Services and pushed to Customer's interviewers' calendars, GoodTime must edit, share and delete access for these events. Employee directory access is established during the implementation process. Customer hereby grants to GoodTime and its sub-processors a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free right and license, during the Subscription Term, to use, copy, store, transmit, distribute, modify, delete, share, perform and display, the Customer Data and Customer's employee directory solely to the extent necessary to provide the GoodTime Service to Customer and to comply with applicable laws and regulations.

All fees are as set forth in the Ordering Document and shall be paid by Customer in US dollars and within 30 days of receipt, unless a different payment term is set forth in the Ordering Document. Payments are non-refundable unless explicitly set forth in this GoodTime MSA. If an Ordering Document specifies any fees for exceeding usage limits or any tiered fees or other additional fees for the applicable GoodTime Service, GoodTime will charge for, and Customer agrees to pay the same.

If Customer believes that GoodTime has billed Customer incorrectly, Customer must contact GoodTime no later than 15 days after receipt of the invoice and failure to do so will result in Customer being deemed to have accepted the invoice. Starting on the 1-year anniversary of the effective date of the applicable Ordering Document and each 6-month anniversary thereafter, Customer shall provide GoodTime with its then-current employee count (as defined in the Ordering Document) and GoodTime will place Customer in the applicable pricing tier for the remainder of the contract.

   (B) "Downtime" means the time that Customer's Permitted Users are not able to (a) access the GoodTime Service, (b) perform ordinary functions to use or receive GoodTime Service in accordance with Documentation, or (c) utilize the GoodTime Service for normal business operations, excluding Excused Downtime.  
   (C) "Excused Downtime" means Downtime as a result of any of the following: (a) System Maintenance, (b) a Force Majeure Event, (c) any failure or malfunction of the technology, network, equipment, product or service of Customer, its Permitted Users or Customer's suppliers, or (d) a suspension of the GoodTime Service due to Customer's breach of the Agreement.  
   (D) "System Availability" with respect to the GoodTime Service will be calculated on a calendar monthly basis using the following formula: (Actual Availability divided by Total Scheduled Availability) multiplied by 100%.  
   (E) "System Maintenance" means time that the GoodTime Services are not accessible to Customer due to maintenance. System Maintenance includes scheduled maintenance and unscheduled, emergency maintenance.  
   (F) "Total Scheduled Availability" means the total number of minutes in a calendar month, excluding Excused Downtime.  
2.2 Service Level Standards. GoodTime will maintain the following service levels for the GoodTime Service (collectively, the "Service Levels"):  
   (A) System Availability Service Level. GoodTime will provide 99.9% System Availability on a calendar month basis.  
   (B) System Maintenance Notice. GoodTime will provide Customer with at least 24 hour prior written notice of any System Maintenance and will use reasonable efforts to provide advance written notice for unscheduled, emergency maintenance. GoodTime will provide such notices to Customer by email to an address provided by Customer or via GoodTime's customer portal. System Maintenance in any given calendar month will not exceed 6 hours per calendar month, and will typically be performed between the hours of 6:00 pm and 3:00 am PT on Fridays and weekends.  
   (C) SLA Credits. To receive a service credit, Customer must submit a claim by emailing GoodTime at support@goodtime.com ("SLA Credit"). To be eligible, the credit request must be received by GoodTime by the end of the second contract calendar month after which the incident occurred and must include:  
   ● the words "SLA Credit Request" in the subject line;  
   ● the dates and times during which the GoodTime Service fell below the minimum 99.9% System Availability; and  
   ● Customer's request logs that document the Downtime and corroborate Customer's claimed outage (any logs or data redacted for privacy or security may be summarized).  
   (D) SLA Credits for System Availability Failure. GoodTime will provide Customer with one (1) SLA Credit for each two (2) full hours of Downtime that occurred during the period of System Availability failure. An SLA Credit is a credit approved and given to Customer in the form of partially extending Customer's Subscription Term. One (1) SLA Credit means one (1) day extension of Customer's Subscription Term and will not result in a refund of any Customer fees due or previously paid. SLA Credits are Customer's exclusive remedy for Downtime.
