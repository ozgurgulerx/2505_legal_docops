[CLAUSE_START: Ordering and Provision of Services]
Supplier will provide the services to LinkedIn described in a purchase order referencing this MSA or a statement of work substantially similar in form to the one at: https://legal.linkedin.com/documents/current SOW US.pdf ("SOW") agreed to by the parties ("Services").

An Affiliate of Supplier, which executes an SOW with LinkedIn to provide Services under this MSA, will be deemed a "Supplier" for that transaction only and that Supplier Affiliate and Supplier will be jointly and severally liable for the Supplier Affiliate's performance under and compliance with the Agreement. "Affiliate" means an entity that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control with, a party. Supplier may subcontract its obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, to a person or entity pre-approved in writing by Linkedln ("Subcontractor") only if Supplier will be solely liable to LinkedIn for Subcontractor's performance under and compliance with the Agreement. Supplier will ensure that each Subcontractor discloses to LinkedIn the location of any LinkedIn data in the Subcontractor's possession or control.

[CLAUSE_START: Changes]
If the parties agree in writing to changes to the scope of Services, the fees payable, or the schedule on which Services will be provided, then the parties will document these changes in a form substantially similar to the one at: https://legal.linkedin.com/documents/current CO US.pdf ("Change Order"). If LinkedIn determines that the changes are substantial, then LinkedIn may require that the parties sign a separate SOW. Each party will use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that any Subcontractor or Affiliate will promptly execute that separate SOW and perform acts as may reasonably be required for the purpose of giving full effect to any agreed upon changes to the Services.

[CLAUSE_START: Acceptance]
Supplier will submit to LinkedIn the items specified in the SOW as deliverables of Supplier subject to the schedule stated in the SOW ("Deliverables"). If LinkedIn reasonably determines that any submitted Deliverable materially fails to meet the specifications or acceptance criteria, if any, stated in the SOW ("Acceptance Criteria"), then Linkedln will provide Supplier with a written statement of errors within 10 business days of receipt of that Deliverable. Supplier will use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly correct the specified errors within 10 business days of the notification of the errors, at no additional cost to LinkedIn. Supplier will then re-deliver the Deliverable and the acceptance provision will be reapplied until LinkedIn accepts the Deliverable or terminates the applicable SOW or the MSA or both in accordance with section 5.
