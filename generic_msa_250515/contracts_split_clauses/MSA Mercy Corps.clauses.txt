[CLAUSE_START: Master Agreement; Specific Services]
From time to time, Mercy Corps may request services from Contractor. For each occasion on which Contractor is willing to provide requested services, the parties will enter into a task order ("Task Order" or "TO") which will describe the services to be performed and the period for performance and which will be substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A. Contractor must notify Mercy Corps within the Task Order Offer Period time specified in Schedule I if it accepts a Task Order, rejects a Task Order or requires changes to a Task Order. Mercy Corps may reject any acceptance or request for changes that Mercy Corps receives after the Task Order Offer Period has expired.

[CLAUSE_START: Delivery of Services]
a. Contractor will perform the Services, and Mercy Corps will pay for the Services, in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement and each TO.

b. Contractor will perform all Services through the services of Contractor's employees. Contractor will not delegate or subcontract any Services to be provided to Mercy Corps without Mercy Corps' prior written consent. Contractor agrees that including the specific individuals named (if any) as Key Personnel in the Additional Terms is a material part of the bargain. Contractor will not change the Key Personnel without prior notice and an amendment to the Additional Terms specifying the change. Mercy Corps may withhold its consent to substitute personnel using its sole discretion.
[CLAUSE_END]

[CLAUSE_START: Compliance with TOs and Changes to TOs]
Services will be provided strictly in accordance with each TO. No deviation, substitution or change is permitted without Mercy Corps' prior written consent; provided that Mercy Corps may terminate, suspend, increase or decrease the scope of Contractor's performance under a TO by written notice to Contractor specifying the changes. Unless mutually agreed, a change to a TO by Mercy Corps does not apply to Services timely and fully delivered and performed before the date of the change. If any change causes an increase or decrease in the cost of, or the time required for, Contractor's performance, an equitable adjustment may be made in the TO or Payment Terms or both, if such adjustment is set forth in an amendment signed by Mercy Corps' and Contractor's Authorized Representative.

Such notice shall clearly state the specific Services disputed, and Mercy Corps' reason for disputing the performance of the Services. If both parties accept the dispute of the invoice, they shall agree in writing as to the steps required of Contractor to ensure that the performance of the disputed Services is subsequently completed in accordance with the Additional Terms, and the time required of Contractor to complete the Services.
