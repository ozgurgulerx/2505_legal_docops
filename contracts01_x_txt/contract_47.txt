Termination rights include those stipulated in Section 9, whereby Customer may terminate this Agreement for cause upon Provider's material breach, which shall include, but not be limited to, failure to meet SLAs, unauthorized use or disclosure of Customer Data, or infringement of third-party intellectual property rights; provided however that Provider shall have a thirty (30) day cure period following receipt of written notice from Customer specifying the breach, during which Provider shall endeavor to rectify said breach to Customer's satisfaction. In the event of termination, Provider shall immediately cease all use of Customer Data and return or destroy all such data in accordance with Customer's instructions.

Provider acknowledges that termination of this Agreement does not relieve Provider of its obligation to pay any fees or charges accrued prior to the date of termination.

## Indemnification Obligations

Provider shall indemnify, defend, and hold Customer harmless from and against any and all claims, actions, suits, proceedings, losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) arising out of or related to (a) Provider's breach of its representations, warranties, or obligations under this Agreement; (b) any infringement or misappropriation of third-party intellectual property rights by the Services; (c) Provider's violation of applicable laws or regulations; or (d) any gross negligence or willful misconduct by Provider or its personnel in the performance of the Services. Customer shall promptly notify Provider of any claim for which it seeks indemnification, and Provider shall have the right to assume the defense of such claim with counsel of its choice. Provider shall not settle any claim without Customer's prior written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. As Customer's complete and exclusive remedy under the circumstances described in the preceding three sentences but subject to the limitations set forth in Section 14, Provider's indemnification obligations shall apply only to the extent that Customer has not contributed to the loss, liability, or damage through its own negligence or misconduct.

## Limitation of Liability

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Provider's total liability to Customer for any and all claims arising out of or related to this Agreement, whether in contract, tort, or otherwise, shall not exceed the greater of (a) the total amount paid by Customer to Provider under this Agreement in the twelve (12) months preceding the claim, or (b) $500,000. In no event shall Provider be liable for any indirect, incidental, consequential, special, punitive, or exemplary damages, including, but not limited to, lost profits, loss of data, or business interruption, arising out of or related to this Agreement, even if Provider has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The limitations set forth in this Section shall apply regardless of the form of action, whether in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, and shall survive termination of this Agreement.

In the event of any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute through good faith negotiations.
