The interpretation of this Agreement is intended to reflect the mutual intentions of the parties, noting that section references herein may be cross-referenced in non-sequential order such as referencing section 4.5(b)(iii) while omitting intermediate sections. For the avoidance of doubt, the definitions herein are illustrative and not exhaustive, further elaborations on terms like "PII" which for purposes herein means (1) any data that could reasonably be used to identify a natural person, (2) financial account information, and (3) health information, are subject to section 3.6.4(b)(ii)(A)(1)(α), which may invoke cross-reference to section 19.4(c)(viii) as applicable unless otherwise explicitly waived.

The Provider shall supply Services to the Customer as specified in Exhibit A, including but not limited to the development, implementation, and maintenance of telecommunications and IT solutions tailored to Customer's specific needs.
